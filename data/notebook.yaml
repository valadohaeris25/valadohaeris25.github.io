          **1.	Experiment**: RFDiffusion-Based Protein Design

          **2.	Time**: 2024.08.29-2024.09.28

          **3.	Member**: Xudong Tang, Yang Jin, Binxuan, Zhang, Kaiqing Zhang, Xuantong Liu

          **4.	Method**: |

            RFDiffusion is a cutting-edge method for de novo protein structure and function design, leveraging the capabilities of deep learning and diffusion models. It is based on the RoseTTAFold (RF) structure prediction network, fine-tuned on protein structure denoising tasks. The principle behind RFDiffusion is to generate protein backbones by iteratively refining noise-corrupted structures, eventually producing functional and structurally accurate proteins from simple molecular specifications.
            (1)	Core Components:
            ①	Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs): These models are trained to reverse the process of adding Gaussian noise to protein structures, thereby generating new, realistic protein structures.
            ②	Rotational Equivariance: RFDiffusion maintains rotational equivariance, allowing it to model three-dimensional (3D) structures in a global representation frame independent manner.
            ③	Conditioning Information: The model can be guided towards specific design objectives by providing conditioning information at each step of the generation process.
            (2)	The procedure of RFDiffusion:
              ①	Model Training
            	Data Preparation: Sample protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and introduce noise to create training inputs.
            	Noise Application: Perturb Cα coordinates with 3D Gaussian noise and apply Brownian motion to residue orientations.
            	Model Training: Train the RFDiffusion model by minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) loss between frame predictions and the true protein structure.
              ②	Protein Design
            	Initialization: Start with random residue frames.
            	Denoising Iterations: Iteratively refine the protein structure by denoising the noisy input, adding noise at each step to generate the input for the next iteration.
            	Sequence Design: Use the ProteinMPNN network to design sequences encoding the generated protein structures.
              ③	Conditioning for Specific Designs
            	Unconditional Design: Generate diverse protein structures without additional input.
            	Topology-Constrained Design: Provide secondary structure and/or fold information to guide the design towards specific topologies.
            	Symmetric Oligomer Design: Specify point group symmetry to create symmetric oligomeric structures.
              ④	Experimental Characterization
            	Expression and Purification: Express the designed proteins in a suitable host and purify them for further analysis.
            	Structural Verification: Use techniques such as circular dichroism (CD) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to verify the structure and stability of the designed proteins.
            	Functional Validation: Assess the functionality of the designed proteins through binding assays, enzymatic activity tests, or other relevant functional assays.
