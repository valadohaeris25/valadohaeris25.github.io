      ### Principle

      RFDiffusion is a cutting-edge method for de novo protein structure and function design, leveraging the capabilities of deep learning and diffusion models. It is based on the RoseTTAFold (RF) structure prediction network, fine-tuned on protein structure denoising tasks. The principle behind RFDiffusion is to generate protein backbones by iteratively refining noise-corrupted structures, eventually producing functional and structurally accurate proteins from simple molecular specifications.

      HDOCK server is a free docking framework based on hybrid docking strategy, which automatically incorporate the binding interface information into traditional global docking, and realize the sampling and scoring of protein and protein docking with robustness and high speed. Although developers claim that HDOCK can realize the docking between protein and nucleic acid, it is still difficult because of the complexity and flexibility of nucleic acid structure. HDOCK server integrates homology search, template-based modeling, structure prediction, global docking, biological information integration and job management, and supports downloading and visual interaction, so it is friendly to non-professional biologist.

      AlphaFold3 is a state-of-the-art protein structure prediction tool developed by DeepMind. It utilizes deep learning techniques to quickly and accurately predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins based on their amino acid sequences. This advanced AI system has significantly improved the speed and accuracy of protein structure predictions, making it a valuable resource for biological research, drug discovery, and understanding the functions of proteins in the body. AlphaFold3 builds upon the success of its predecessors, offering a more efficient and reliable way to predict protein structures, which can aid in the development of new therapeutics and deepen our understanding of biological systems.


      ### Method

      A.	RFDiffusion

      1. Model Training

      ①	Data Preparation: Sample protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and introduce noise to create training inputs.

      ②	Noise Application: Perturb Cα coordinates with 3D Gaussian noise and apply Brownian motion to residue orientations.

      ③	Model Training: Train the RFDiffusion model by minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) loss between frame predictions and the true protein structure.

        2.	Protein Design

      ①	Initialization: Start with random residue frames.

      ②	Denoising Iterations: Iteratively refine the protein structure by denoising the noisy input, adding noise at each step to generate the input for the next iteration.

      ③	Sequence Design: Use the ProteinMPNN network to design sequences encoding the generated protein structures.

        3.	Conditioning for Specific Designs

      ①	Unconditional Design: Generate diverse protein structures without additional input.

      ②	Topology-Constrained Design: Provide secondary structure and/or fold information to guide the design towards specific topologies.

      ③	Symmetric Oligomer Design: Specify point group symmetry to create symmetric oligomeric structures.

        4.	Experimental Characterization

      ①	Expression and Purification: Express the designed proteins in a suitable host and purify them for further analysis.

      ②	Structural Verification: Use techniques such as circular dichroism (CD) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to verify the structure and stability of the designed proteins.

      ③	Functional Validation: Assess the functionality of the designed proteins through binding assays, enzymatic activity tests, or other relevant functional assays.



      B.	HDOCK

      1.	Data input

      The HDOCK web server is available at http://hdock.phys.hust.edu.cn/. Both sequence and structure information of ligand and receptor should be uploaded through the website separately. The docking process will be carried out in the server. Click submit to wait for the results. Generally, the waiting time is approximately 30 minutes. The submitted sequences should be in FASTA format and contain only standard amino acids. The structure should be in PDB format. In addition, residue information of the binding sitei is also possible to be submitted as a filter in the docking process.

      2.	Docking preparation

      First, the homologous sequences of molecules will be searched by sequence similarity search. The template with the highest sequence coverage, highest sequence similarity and highest resolution will be selected to build the template-based model. ClustalW is used for sequence alignment, and MODELLER is used for model construction. This step will be executed on the server.

      3.	Global docking

      HDOCKlite, a layered docking program based on FFT, is used to globally sample the presumed binding directions. If the binding site information was provided when submitting, the docking process will also include it. The ranked binding modes are clustered with an RMSD cutoff of 5 Å. if two binding modes have a ligand RMSD of ≤ 5 Å, the one with the better score is kept. This step will be executed on the server. The docking model of HDOCKlite and the template-based docking model of MODELLER will be provided for download through web interaction.

      4.	Results analysis

      The server will send the top 10 docking models to the website. The results page contains an interactive visualization window and a summary table. The summary table usually contains docking energy score, confidence score and ligand RMSD. If the SAXS data file is provided, the SAXS chi-square of the model can also be displayed. Results can also be downloaded as a PDB file, using the molecular visualization software PyMOL to open and view the predicted model.

      C.	AlphaFold3

      1.	Data Retrieval

      ①	Retrieve Template Structures: The model retrieves template structures from PDBmmCIF files. This involves parsing the files to extract the relevant structural information that can serve as a template for the prediction of the target protein structure.

      ②	Database Sequence Retrieval: Retrieve protein sequences from five databases to be used for multiple sequence alignment (MSA). And retrieve RNA sequences from three databases, also for MSA purposes. These sequences help in understanding the evolutionary context and the potential interactions with the protein of interest.

        2.	Sequence and Token Processing

      ①	Tokenization: Convert the input sequences (protein and RNA), ligands, and covalent bonds into tokens. Tokenization is the process of breaking the sequences into smaller units that can be processed by the neural network.

      ②	Embedding: Input the tokens into an embedder, which is a component of the neural network designed to convert tokens into high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) that capture their meaning in the context of the model. The embedder will output three types of embeddings:

      Input Embeddings: Representations of the input sequences.

      Single Embeddings: Representations of individual tokens.

      Pair Embeddings: Representations of pairs of tokens, which capture the relationships between different parts of the sequences.

        3.	Structure Generation and Refinement

      ①	Integration of Information: Combine the template structure information with the pair embeddings obtained from the feature extraction module. Integrate MSA information to generate a pair representation that captures the evolutionary and structural relationships within the sequences.

      ②	Representation Regulation: Use the Pairformer module to organize and update the single representation and pair representation information. This module ensures that the relationships between different parts of the protein are accurately reflected in the model's representations. And the single and pair representations are updated iteratively through multiple cycles to refine and improve their accuracy.

      ③	Structure Prediction: Pass the encoded information through a diffusion model, which progressively adds noise to the data and then denoises it to generate a clear three-dimensional structure of the protein. Then use metrics such as pLDDT (predicted local distance difference testing), PAE (predicted alignment error), and PDE (predicted distance error) to assess the confidence of the predicted structure. These metrics provide insight into the quality and reliability of the predicted protein structure.

      ### Principle

      The lentiviral vector packaging system consists of two main components: the packaging component and the vector component. The packaging component is created by removing cis-acting sequences necessary for HIV-1 genome packaging, reverse transcription, and integration, allowing it to provide essential proteins for viral particle production. In contrast, the vector component contains these required cis-acting sequences along with a polyclonal site regulated by a heterologous promoter where a target gene can be inserted. By co-transfecting packaging cells with multiple plasmids of the vector components, replication-defective lentiviral particles carrying target genes can be produced.

        {{< image src="images/docs/protocol/p2.png" >}}

      ### Method

      1. Cell Preparation: Seed HEK293T cells in a 10 cm dish at a density of 3-4 × 106 cells per dish in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen-Strep. Incubate the cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO₂ atmosphere until they reach 70-80% confluence (approximately 24 hours).

      2. Transfection: Prepare the DNA-PEI complex. For each 10 cm dish, use 10 µg of the lentiviral transfer plasmid, 5 µg of pMD2.G, and 7.5 µg of psPAX2. Dilute the plasmids in 500 µL of serum-free DMEM. Separately, dilute 60 µL of 1 mg/mL PEI in 500 µL of serum-free DMEM. Combine the DNA solution with the PEI solution, mix gently, and incubate at room temperature for 20 min to allow the formation of DNA-PEI complexes.

      3. Transfection Addition: Add the DNA-PEI complex dropwise to the HEK293T cells. Swirl the dish gently to distribute the complex evenly. Incubate the cells at 37°C in a 5% CO₂ atmosphere.

      4. Medium Change: After 6-8 hours, replace the transfection medium with fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen-Strep to reduce toxicity.

      5. Virus Harvesting: Collect the supernatant containing lentiviral particles at 48 and 72 hours post-transfection. Pool the supernatants and centrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris.

      6. Supernatant Filtration: Filter the supernatant through a 0.45 µm filter to ensure the removal of any remaining cellular debris.

      7. Virus Concentration: Concentrate the viral particles by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 2 hours at 4°C. Carefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the viral pellet in an appropriate volume of PBS or DMEM.

      8. Virus Storage: Aliquot the concentrated virus and store at -80 °C until use. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.

      ### Principle

      Organoid culture technology refers to a group of cells with self-renewal and self-organisation capabilities cultured in an in vitro environment. These cells can be derived from primary cells, embryonic stem cells or multipotent stem cells. They possess organ-like structure and function and can mimic in vivo tissue structure and function to the greatest extent possible. They can also be passaged long-term and used as an experimental model for patient individualization.

      Typical organoid culture protocols commence with the isolation of embryonic stem cells or pluripotent stem cells, which are subsequently cultured in a supportive medium to facilitate three-dimensional cell growth. The signaling pathways that mediate organoid formation are the same as those used for organ development and maintenance of homeostasis in vivo. Consequently, a variety of cytokines, growth factors and small molecule compounds must be introduced during the culture process in order to activate or inhibit specific cell signaling pathways. The primary component of the culture is Matrix Gel, a natural soluble basement membrane matrix extracted from extracellular matrix protein-rich mouse tumors. It consists of a range of extracellular matrix components, including laminin, collagen type IV and nestin, and provides support, tensile strength and scaffolding support for tissues and cells (Fig.).

      ### Method

      1. The process of digesting human liver tumor tissue

      (1) The tumor tissue should be chopped into pieces measuring between 0.5 and 1 mm³ under sterile conditions and placed into a 100 mm petri dish.

      (2) The chopped tissue should then be submerged into a 15 mL centrifuge tube, with approximately 10 mL of ice-cold washing medium added. The tissue should then be gently agitated with a 10 mL pipette to precipitate the tumor tissue. The supernatant, including blood cells and floating fat mass, should be discarded, and this step should be repeated once.

      (3) A volume of approximately 4-5 mL of pre-warmed human liver digest should be added per gram of tissue. The solution should then be placed on a test-tube rotary shaker in an incubator at 37 °C, mixed thoroughly, and allowed to digest.

      (4) Following a 30-minute digestion period, the solution should be agitated to ascertain the presence of single cells. In the event of a low concentration of single cells, the solution should be returned to 37 °C and the digestion process continued. The suspension should be monitored at 10-minute intervals for a maximum of 90 min, with digestion halted when the suspension contains 80-100% single cells.

      (5) Upon completion of the digestion process, the solution should be filtered through a 70 µm filter and then through a second filter, which should be pre-cooled, before being added to the washing medium.

      (6) Centrifuge at 4 ℃ and 300×g for 5 min, discard the supernatant, and add pre-cooled washing medium to 15 mL.

      (7) Centrifuge at 300×g for 5 min at 4 °C, discard the supernatant, and then add pre-cooled washing medium to 15 mL.

      2. Inoculation of liver cancer cells

      (1) The supernatant should be removed, and the cells should be resuspended in BME2 matrix gel. The cells should then be inoculated into 24-well plates with the matrix gel kept at a low temperature throughout the process.

      (2) Add 500 µL of medium per well in the 24-well plate and incubate in a cell culture box.

      (3) The medium should be replaced with a fresh one after a period of three to four days.

      ### Principle

      Immunodeficient mice are a kind of mice whose immune system function is inhibited or lost through genetic modification, which makes them an important experimental tool in many biomedical research fields. Because of their incomplete immune system, these mice can receive xenotransplantation of cells or tissues, such as humans, for a variety of research applications.

      ### Method

      The luciferase gene-labeled HCC cell line in the logarithmic growth phase was digested and prepared into 5×107 cell/mL cell suspension by HBSS.

      1. The NCG mice were anesthetized and opened about 1 cm horizontally under the xiphoid process, and part of the liver was exposed by squeezing the left and right abdominal cavity. 100 μL of the prepared cells were injected into the liver of the nude mice with 1 mL insulin injection needle. At the same time, the needle was drawn and the assistant used Vetbond Tissue Adhesive to quickly close the pinhole to prevent bleeding and tumor cell outflow to form intraperitoneal implantation.

      2. The liver was gently pushed back into the abdominal cavity with a cotton rod wet with normal saline, and the abdomen was closed.

      3. Subsequent tumor volume was monitored by small animal imaging.

      ### Principle

      The TME significantly influences the biological characteristics of tumor cells. Subcutaneous implanted tumors are removed from their primary tissue microenvironment, resulting in development that deviates from clinical reality. Additionally, this model exhibits poor drug responsiveness, low metastatic rates, and survival curve data that do not correlate with clinical outcomes. To address these limitations, an in-situ transplantation model of tumor cell lines was constructed using primary cultured tumor cells. This model enables the assessment of drug efficacy and disease progression through various methods, including the observation of clinical symptoms in mice, survival times, tumor volume measurements, and the use of bioluminescent imaging to track luciferase-labeled tumor cells. This approach allows for real-time monitoring of tumor growth, distribution, and metastasis. Given the unique tumor growth microenvironment of liver cancer, coupled with the liver being the largest immunologically privileged organ in the human body, in situ tumor formation represents the optimal model for exploring adoptive immunotherapy for liver cancer.

      ### Method

      1. Cell Culture

      Pancreatic cancer cells tumor cell  were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin and maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO₂.

      2. Construction of the In Situ Pancreatic Cancer Tumor Model

      (1) Cell preparation

      Tumor cells were seeded in 10 cm culture dishes using DMEM medium (containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO₂ atmosphere until the cells reached the logarithmic growth phase.

      (2) Harvesting cells with trypsin

      1 mL of 0.25% trypsin was added to each 10 cm dish for digestion for 1 min. Afterward, 2 mL of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added to terminate the digestion. The cell suspension was transferred to a 15 mL centrifuge tube, and 5 mL of PBS was added to wash the dish. The solution was collected into the 15 mL tube, centrifuged at 1000 rpm/min for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The tumor cell cells were then resuspended in PBS, centrifuged again at 1000 rpm/min for 5 min, and the wash was repeated twice.

      (3) Cell counting

      The harvested tumor cell cells were resuspended in PBS, counted, and adjusted to a final concentration of 2×10⁷ cell/mL.

      (4) Anesthesia of mice

      Each mouse received an intraperitoneal injection of the anesthetic pentobarbital (150-200 μL), and the injection site was disinfected with 75% ethanol prior to administration.

      (5) Injection of tumor cell

      After anesthesia, the abdomen of the mouse was disinfected with povidone-iodine using a cotton swab. A longitudinal incision of approximately 1 cm was made in the left upper abdomen with ophthalmic surgical scissors. The spleen was gently elevated using a sterile cotton swab to visualize it, followed by careful exploration of the pancreas. Once the pancreas was located, the tip of the tail was grasped with curved ophthalmic forceps and gently pulled to expose the pancreas (care was taken to avoid rupturing the spleen). A 27-gauge needle was used with a 1 mL syringe to gently insert the needle into the pancreas from the tail end towards the head region, ensuring that it did not penetrate through the pancreas to prevent leakage of pancreatic fluid, which could lead to the death of the mouse. Each mouse received an injection of 50 μL containing 2×10⁷ cell/mL of tumor cell cells (successful injections were indicated by a visible small blister formation; if the pancreas was punctured, leakage of the cell suspension would be observed). After the injection, the direction of the needle was slightly adjusted, and the cell suspension was slowly injected while withdrawing the needle. Applying gentle pressure with a sterile cotton swab at the injection site for a moment effectively prevented leakage. The spleen and pancreas were then gently returned to the abdominal cavity, and the skin and peritoneum were sutured using 3-0 surgical sutures. Post-surgery, the mice were placed in a warm environment illuminated by incandescent light until they awakened naturally
