      In the local hospital, we conversed with patients suffering from tumors and introduced them to new approaches in tumor immunotherapy. We explained various cytokines used in cancer treatment in plain language, complementing the explanation with hand-drawn cartoon illustrations to aid patients' understanding. For patients and their families who showed interest or had a background in medical knowledge, we provided detailed information about the application of protein design in cancer therapy and our research on modifying IL-2/15.

      With the advancement of medical research, an increasing number of experiments rely on animal studies for pre-clinical research. Therefore, promoting innovation in experimental methods through new technologies is crucial to reducing the use of animals in research. We aim to share our application of synthetic biology in the context of animal experiments, as well as provide some educational insights on the topic.

      We visited the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where we learned about the local tumor epidemiology from the staff and jointly analyzed how to improve the survival status of patients. Significantly, we engaged in academic exchanges with researchers from the CDC through science popularization lectures and posting promotional posters/boards. From this collaboration, we gained a lot: their research, which uses directed evolution technology, shows promise in enhancing the effectiveness of drug interventions, and it inspired us to expand our therapeutic strategy system. By leveraging directed evolution, we stand at the threshold of creating more targeted and safer treatment modalities.

      During the community visits, Fan Yang of our team entered the homes of some cancer patients, offered them condolences, and introduced the vigorous development of medical research in the field of cancer. In addition, we used questionnaires to understand the needs and expectations of community residents for cancer treatment. During the visits, we also introduced the development of protein design and its applications in the field of cancer treatment to the community residents and staff. This community service reinforced our commitment to advancing the design of IL-2, confident it will offer hope to more cancer suffers.
