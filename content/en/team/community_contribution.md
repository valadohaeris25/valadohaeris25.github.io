      In local hospitals, we approached the bedside to communicate and interact with patients, introducing the concept of cell therapy. We used cartoon images to present the complex CAR-T therapy to patients. For the patients who were interested in it, we additionally talked about CAR-NK therapy based on our research projects, extremely broadening their understanding of cellular therapies. Although patients had different opinions on CAR-T, most of which believed that cell therapy could provide more help for clinical treatment in the near future. And for us, we successfully let more people know about cell therapy, illuminating beacons of hope for more lives.

      With the advancement of medical research, an increasing number of experiments rely on animal studies for pre-clinical research. Therefore, promoting innovation in experimental methods through new technologies is crucial to reducing the use of animals in research. We aim to share our application of synthetic biology in the context of animal experiments, as well as provide some educational insights on the topic.

      Hanyue Liu of our team elucidated the principles of directed evolution to the assembly of biomedical researchers, highlighting its role as a sophisticated strategy that emulates natural selection to facilitate the controlled evolution of biomolecules within a laboratory setting. This innovative approach holds the potential to enhance pharmacological interventions and to broaden our repertoire of therapeutic strategies, particularly in the realm of autoimmune disorders. By harnessing directed evolution, we stand on the cusp of creating more targeted and secure treatment modalities that could usher in a new era of hope for those afflicted.

      For those developing targeted drugs for solid tumors, we described the concept and basic workflow of directed mutagenesis. Through a deep understanding of directed mutagenesis, drug developers may design and optimize drug structures more accurately. The heterogeneous tumor micro-environment restricted the efficacy of drugs in the treatment of solid tumors. Directed mutagenesis provides a way to enhance drug adaptability and efficacy, enabling flexible structural modifications.

      During visits to university and hospital neighborhoods, we crafted educational materials based on our CAR-NK therapy research, aiming to spread knowledge on its cancer treatment applications. With the support of the residents' committees, we held lectures and Q&As, engaging audiences across ages. During these events, we elaborated on the fundamental principles and advantages of CAR-NK therapy, highlighting its promising direction for future cancer immunotherapy. This community service reinforced our commitment to advancing CAR-NK, confident it will offer hope to more cancer sufferers.
